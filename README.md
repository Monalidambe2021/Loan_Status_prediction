# Loan_Status_prediction
End-To-end machine learning project to predict loan status with deployment using Flask

In this project, i am going to solve the Loan Approval Prediction. This is a classification problem in which we need to classify whether the loan will be approved or not. classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data. A few examples of classification problems are Spam Email detection, Cancer detection, Sentiment Analysis, 

After the Final Submission of test data, my accuracy score was 78%.

Feature engineering helped me increase my accuracy.

Amazingly random forest classifier worked better than all other Ensemble models.
